### A chatbot is software that simulates human-like conversations with users via text messages on chat.

A chatbot or chatterbot is a software application used to conduct an on-line chat conversation via text or text-to-speech, in lieu of providing direct contact with a live human agent.

Its key task is to help users by providing answers to their questions. Bots can chat with multiple users simultaneously and provide information within seconds.

Because of that, they are now used on a wide scale to help businesses and consumers communicate with each other on websites and mobile messaging apps.

Chatbots are powered by pre-programmed responses, artificial intelligence, or both. Based on the applied mechanism, they process a user's question to deliver a matching answer.

An AI chatbot is a piece of software that can freely communicate with users. AI communication application are much better conversationalists than their rule-based counterparts because they leverage machine learning, natural language processing (NLP), and sentiment analysis.

Machine Learning (ML) allows bots to identify patterns in user input, make decisions, and learn from past conversations.

Natural Language Processing (NLP) helps bots understand how humans communicate and enable them to replicate that behavior. NLP lets them understand the context of the conversation even if a person makes a spelling mistake or uses jargon.

The sentiment analysis helps a chatbot understand users' emotions.

AI communication bots need to be well-trained and equipped with predefined responses to get started. However, as they learn from past conversations, they don't need to be updated manually later.

AI bots can understand multiple languages and read the customer's mood. This enables them to personalize their communication with the user.
